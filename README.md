# Context-Switching-Audio-Listening

This is a script written in Python and AppleScript for a smooth audio listening experience while using a MacBook. Currently, it's quite basic. It plays Spotify music when the user is using any apps other than watching YouTube. When a YouTube tab is opened in the forefront, it pauses Spotify.


I found it useful while following coding tutorial videos. When I pause the video to write code myself, I usually have to turn on the music manually and turn it off when I return to the video, which is tedious.

Of course, this script is currently very simple and based only on basic rules. I will probably extend it soon.

Simply run the code in a Macbook. You also need to have Spotify app installed.

```
  python3 audio_switch.py
```
